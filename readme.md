ParkCBR widgets

This project features two proof of concepts for enhancing the ACT Government Smart Parking data to improve access to local businesses. The first is an enhancement of Google business search results which considers parking availability near a business. The second is a widget that businesses can add to their websites to show current parking availability.

Basically, this Chrome extension demonstrates how a big company like Google could integrate the Smart Parking data into their products, similar to the way Google maps already uses ACT transit data when calculating routes. 

Our project detects that a google results page is showing its special business info box on the sidebar with links and opening hours. 

It then detects that the listed address is Canberra based, so it connects with the Canberra smart parking system to provide additional useful information to the consumer. This uses the live API, so it’s providing consumers with up to the minute results, which may influence their decision to visit a local business. 

This approach could be used in any directory-style business listing and could be integrated with the available parking data in a generic and open way. In the future, we could have it calculate peak parking times so consumers can research the best time to visit a business they’re looking at.

The second is an example of how the data can be inserted as a widget onto a business website. This is similar to the way businesses use social media widgets. This can help small businesses give their potential customers information that makes visiting the business as convenient as possible. 
The widget is designed to change colour depending on the number of available parks. 
For instance, if it’s green, there are more than 10 parks within 200 meters and if it’s red there are fewer than 10. This can be updated in the future to cover more scenarios. All it takes is a few lines of code, and the business is supported.

These two examples of enhancing Smart Parking data give power to both consumers and businesses. They are built as Chrome extensions for the proof of concept, but the concept can be expanded across many other platforms.
